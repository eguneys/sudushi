### NOTES

- [ ] Click sets up a waypoint for hero to follow. Latest click takes priority. 
- [ ] If you click and drag, it doesn't count as a click and nothing happens. This might feel like a nuisance, and we might want to either give visual feedback or do something special about this behaviour.
- [ ] An idea about accumulating 3 clicks, and player patrols between clicked waypoints.
- [ ] Having multiple heros, and switching between them to set them up at strategic places to trap enemies.
- [ ] A level up, health, and maybe ammo system.
- [ ] Types of guns, enemies, powerups, heros
- [ ] We can tweak the way entities move, avoidance, attraction, speed, it's about giving a specific amount of force for a specific direction for a specific amount of time and repeat after a delay.
